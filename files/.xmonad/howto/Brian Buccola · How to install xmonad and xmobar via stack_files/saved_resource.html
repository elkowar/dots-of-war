If so, then if you run lightdm by executing ~/.local/bin/xmonad, then recompiling won't update your session (because lightdm is looking at ~/.local/bin/xmonad, not /usr/bin/xmonad, and it's the latter that is being rebuilt), whereas if you run lightdm by executing /usr/bin/xmonad (symlinked to ~/.local/bin/xmonad), then recompiling will update your session.\n\nYou could test this by deleting the /usr/bin/xmonad symlink, editing your lightdm to execute ~/.local/bin/xmonad, logging out and back in, and recompiling. If you see that /usr/bin/xmonad has been created, then xmonad is recompiling itself 'as root' instead of 'as user'.","isAtFlagLimit":false,"isHighlighted":false,"canVote":false,"forum":"brianbuccola","depth":7,"points":1,"moderationLabels":[],"isEdited":false,"sb":false},{"editableUntil":"2018-11-20T09:33:08","dislikes":0,"thread":"7110920023","numReports":0,"likes":0,"message":"\u003cp>Also, when /usr/bin/xmonad is not present, I see this in my .xsession-errors:\u003cbr>```\u003cbr>/bin/sh: line 0: type: xmonad: not found\u003cbr>/bin/sh: xmessage: command not found\u003cbr>```\u003c/p>\u003cp>Which basically means the executable was not on the path.

If so, remove the packages that were installed into /usr/bin.</p><p>In Arch Linux, you can use pacman to query which package owns a file:</p><p>$ pacman -Qo /usr/bin/xmonad</p><p>and then remove that package.

Yes, in my first attempts on Manjaro, I installed xmonad and xmobar directly using pacman. Realising that things were broken with that install, I followed your instructions, but didn't remove the packages previously installed. <br>I'm not sure what the correct process here should be: I can remove these packages from my system, but will that also mean I can still use xmonad as my session on lightdm? I'm not sure where lightdm looks to determine the available WMs on a system but maybe I should look into that.</p></div></div><span class="post-media"><ul

So it must have something to do with lightdm. Maybe running xmonad from lightdm is like running it as root, and so running xmonad --recompile puts the xmonad binary into /usr/bin (root's binaries) instead of ~/.local/bin (user's binaries). If so, then if you run lightdm by executing ~/.local/bin/xmonad, then recompiling won't update your session (because lightdm is looking at ~/.local/bin/xmonad, not /usr/bin/xmonad, and it's the latter that is being rebuilt), whereas if you run lightdm by executing /usr/bin/xmonad (symlinked to ~/.local/bin/xmonad), then recompiling will update your session.</p><p>You could test this by deleting the /usr/bin/xmonad symlink, editing your lightdm to execute ~/.local/bin/xmonad, logging out and back in, and recompiling. If you see that /usr/bin/xmonad has been created, then xmonad is recompiling itself 'as root' instead of 'as user'.</p></div></div><span class="post-media"><ul
